# FETCHING GHIBLI API :tv:
This is a little practice to apply my knowledge and skills acquired in my FSD course.
First I read the data from the API and then I use HTML and CSS to make a user interface where you can find an interactive carousel and see all the available movies. When clicking on any of the movies, a modal is displayed with the title and description of the selected movie. In addition to that, there is a multiple choice form with all possible movies which the user can interact in the same way as clicking on the desired image.
